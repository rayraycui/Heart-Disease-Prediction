# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project uses the Heart disease prediction dataset on kaggle to predict whether or not a given patient has heart diseaes given features like age, max heart rate, resting bp etc.

STEPS:

1. I first imported all of the librarie needed for this project such as sklearn, pandas, and numpy. I then read in the csv file (notice how this csv file is not presplit into training and testing data)

2. I then used df.iloc to make the program read in the first 11 columns of data from the tabular datset.
